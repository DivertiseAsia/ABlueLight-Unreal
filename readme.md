This project was the one of the last pushes into trying to make an internal game (2022) for Divertise.

Made with unreal. One prototype level under a different branch phop/complex-level

**unmaintained**

Note:

first-place.blend.part_x files used to be first-place.blend -> they have been split apart for github and removed from git history. It was originally added in commit - ed8322b and updated in 432ccb1

To put it back together if you need ->

linux:
cat first-place.blend_part\_\* > first-place.blend

windows:
copy /b first-place.blend_part_aa+first-place.blend_part_ab+first-place.blend_part_ac first-place.blend
